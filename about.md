It's been an interesting journey to data. My traditional schooling was in Chemistry. I have a B.S. in Chemistry and an M.S. in Forensic Science with a focus on Toxicology. I've worked as a children's entertainer (I make awesome balloon animals), had my own tutoring business, been a cook in a Lebanese restaurant, and worked for a non-profit in the foster care system. I've finally settled in tech, and I work for an amazing startup in Austin that is trying to fix medical school and make the world a better place. 
### More Information

I collect hobbies. Right now I'm into fountain pens, typewriters, fancy goldfish, and sustainable agriculture. Who knows what's around the corner, though!
