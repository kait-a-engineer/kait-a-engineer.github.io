This is a blog about stumbling upon a field, falling in love with it, and trying to woo it. I've had a lot of jobs, but none that I've found as challenging and rewarding as data engineering. I'm here to answer the ultimate question: Will what I don't know kill me?

I'm definitely in that uneasy place where someone will say the name of a technology, or mention a data structure term I'm unfamiliar with and I will freeze in place and hope no one sees me. Turns out my coworkers' vision is NOT based on movement, so my plan B is to learn and grow as much as I can over the next year, while applying that knowledge to building a robust system for my team. 

I will be compiling resources here, working through tutorials, ruminating about concepts, and hopefully giving back to the community I have received so much value from. Thank you for reading and I hope this blog provides you with some value. <3
